# 🌟 File to Database Interface 🌟

**File to Database** is a Python application designed to simplify converting CSV or Excel files into MySQL databases. With a user-friendly GUI, it automates processes like database creation and table population, making it ideal for developers, analysts, and data managers.

## 🥅 Goals of the Project

This project aims to:  
- 📦 **Streamline Data Migration**: Provide a tool for converting raw files into structured MySQL databases.  
- 🛠️ **Minimize Manual Work**: Eliminate the need for writing repetitive SQL queries for database creation.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Enable User Accessibility**: Offer a GUI that makes the process intuitive, even for non-developers.  
- 🔄 **Ensure Data Integrity**: Properly handle data formatting and validation during migration.  

---

## 🔄 Process

Here's how the application works behind the scenes:  

1. **File Selection**:  
   The user selects a CSV or Excel file through the graphical interface.  

2. **Validation**:  
   - The app validates the file format and ensures compatibility.  
   - It parses headers to prepare column names for database tables.  

3. **Database Configuration**:  
   - The user enters MySQL database credentials (e.g., host, user, password, and database name).  
   - If the database doesn’t exist, the app creates it automatically.  

4. **Table Generation**:  
   - The app analyzes the file structure and dynamically creates a matching table.  
   - Column data types are inferred based on the file content.  

5. **Data Upload**:  
   - Rows from the file are inserted into the created table.  
   - Logs are generated to highlight errors or successful uploads.
